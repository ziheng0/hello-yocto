This is just a minimal project. Downloading only bitbake will compile the recipe, which can help us understand the most basic workflow of bitbake. You can find more instructions for further testing in the bitbake manual.

Introduction
============
BitBake is, at its simplest, a tool for executing tasks and managing metadata. As such, its similarities to GNU make and other build tools are readily apparent. It was inspired by Portage, the package management system used by the Gentoo Linux distribution.
BitBake is the basis of the OpenEmbedded project, which is being used to build and maintain a number of embedded Linux distributions.
